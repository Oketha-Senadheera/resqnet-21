# Collection Points Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a complete collection points management system for NGO users to create, view, edit, and delete collection points where donors can drop off donations.

## Components Created

### 1. Database Schema

- **collection_points table**: Added to `resqnet_schema.sql`
  - `collection_point_id` (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY)
  - `ngo_id` (INT, NOT NULL) - Foreign key to ngos(user_id)
  - `name` (VARCHAR(150), NOT NULL)
  - `location_landmark` (VARCHAR(150))
  - `full_address` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)
  - `contact_person` (VARCHAR(100))
  - `contact_number` (VARCHAR(20))
  - Foreign key constraint with CASCADE delete

### 2. Model Class

- **CollectionPoint.java**: Main model representing a collection point
  - Maps to the `collection_points` database table
  - Contains fields: collectionPointId, ngoId, name, locationLandmark, fullAddress, contactPerson, contactNumber
  - Standard JavaBean with getters and setters

### 3. DAO Layer

- **CollectionPointDAO.java**: Data access object for database operations
  - `create()`: Insert new collection point and return generated ID
  - `update()`: Update existing collection point
  - `delete()`: Delete collection point by ID
  - `findById()`: Get collection point by ID (returns Optional)
  - `findByNgoId()`: Get all collection points for a specific NGO (ordered by name)
  - Private `map()` method to convert ResultSet to CollectionPoint object

### 4. Controllers (Servlets)

All servlets are in the `com.resqnet.controller.ngo` package and require NGO role authentication:

- **ManageCollectionPointsServlet.java** (`/ngo/manage-collection`)
  - GET: Display manage collection points page with all collection points for the logged-in NGO
  - Fetches collection points using `findByNgoId()`
  - Sets collection points as request attribute for JSP

- **CollectionPointAddServlet.java** (`/ngo/collection-points/add`)
  - POST: Process new collection point creation
    - Validates required fields (name, full_address)
    - Creates collection point associated with logged-in NGO
    - Redirects with success/error message

- **CollectionPointEditServlet.java** (`/ngo/collection-points/edit`)
  - POST: Process collection point updates
    - Validates ownership (collection point belongs to logged-in NGO)
    - Validates required fields
    - Updates collection point information
    - Redirects with success/error message

- **CollectionPointDeleteServlet.java** (`/ngo/collection-points/delete`)
  - POST: Delete collection point
    - Validates ownership (collection point belongs to logged-in NGO)
    - Deletes collection point from database
    - Redirects with success/error message

### 5. JSP View

- **manage-collection-points.jsp** (`/WEB-INF/views/ngo/collection-points/manage-collection-points.jsp`)
  - Uses the `ngo-dashboard` layout tag for consistent UI
  - Displays collection points in a table format
  - Features:
    - Add new collection point form at the top
    - Table showing all current collection points (Name, Location/Landmark, Full Address, Actions)
    - Edit and Delete buttons for each collection point
    - Success/error message alerts
    - Client-side form handling for inline editing
    - JavaScript for dynamic table population from server data
    - Responsive design with mobile-friendly layout
    - Confirmation dialog for delete action
  - Form fields:
    - Collection Point Name (required)
    - Location Name/Landmark (optional)
    - Full Address (required)
    - Contact Person (optional)
    - Phone Number (optional)

## Security Features

- Role-based access control: Only NGO users can access these pages
- Session validation on all requests
- SQL injection prevention through PreparedStatements
- Ownership validation: NGOs can only edit/delete their own collection points
- CSRF protection through proper form handling
- Input validation (required fields)
- Error handling with proper status codes (403 Forbidden for unauthorized access)

## Database Schema

The `collection_points` table:
- Foreign key from `collection_points.ngo_id` to `ngos.user_id` with CASCADE delete
- When an NGO is deleted, all its collection points are automatically deleted
- Ensures data integrity and proper relationships

## URL Routes

- `/ngo/manage-collection` - Display manage collection points page (GET)
- `/ngo/collection-points/add` - Add new collection point (POST)
- `/ngo/collection-points/edit` - Edit collection point (POST, requires ?id= parameter)
- `/ngo/collection-points/delete` - Delete collection point (POST, requires ?id= parameter)

## Features

✅ List all collection points for the logged-in NGO in a table
✅ Add new collection points with required and optional fields
✅ Edit existing collection points with inline form
✅ Delete collection points with confirmation dialog
✅ Success/error message feedback
✅ Responsive design for mobile devices
✅ Clean, reusable NGO dashboard layout
✅ Form validation (client-side and server-side)
✅ Role-based access control
✅ Ownership validation
✅ Empty state message when no collection points exist

## Testing Notes

To test this feature:

1. Log in as an NGO user
2. Click on "Manage Collection Points" in the NGO dashboard sidebar
3. Test adding a new collection point:
   - Fill in required fields (Name, Full Address)
   - Optionally fill in Location/Landmark, Contact Person, Phone Number
   - Click "Add Collection Point"
   - Verify success message appears
   - Verify new collection point appears in the table
4. Test editing a collection point:
   - Click "Edit" button on any collection point
   - Verify form is populated with existing data
   - Modify some fields
   - Click "Update Collection Point"
   - Verify success message appears
   - Verify changes are reflected in the table
5. Test deleting a collection point:
   - Click "Delete" button on any collection point
   - Verify confirmation dialog appears
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify success message appears
   - Verify collection point is removed from the table
6. Test validation:
   - Try to add a collection point without required fields
   - Verify error message appears
7. Test responsive design on different screen sizes
8. Test that other NGO users cannot see or modify this NGO's collection points

## Integration with Dashboard

- The "Manage Collection Points" button in the NGO dashboard sidebar (ngo-dashboard.tag) links to `/ngo/manage-collection`
- The link is already configured in the ngo-dashboard.tag file (line 61)
- The active page is set to "manage-collection" for proper sidebar highlighting

## Code Quality

- ✅ Follows existing project patterns and conventions
- ✅ Uses existing layout components for consistency
- ✅ Minimal, focused changes
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (Model, DAO, Controller, View)
- ✅ Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Security best practices (PreparedStatements, ownership validation)
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities (CodeQL verified - 0 alerts)
- ✅ Compiles without errors
- ✅ Successfully builds WAR file

## Relationship to Problem Statement

This implementation fully addresses the requirements:
1. ✅ Database table created as specified in the problem statement
2. ✅ One-to-many relationship between NGO and collection points (one NGO can have many collection points, one collection point belongs to one NGO)
3. ✅ Collection points owned by an NGO are displayed in the manage-collection-points page when the NGO logs in
4. ✅ Sidebar "Manage Collection Points" button redirects to the corresponding page
5. ✅ Full CRUD operations implemented (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
