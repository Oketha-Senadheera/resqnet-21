# Grama Niladhari Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented a complete Grama Niladhari management system for DMC admins to register, view, edit, and delete Grama Niladhari accounts.

## Components Created

### 1. Model Classes

- **GramaNiladhari.java**: Main model representing a Grama Niladhari profile

  - Maps to the `grama_niladhari` database table
  - Contains fields: userId, name, contactNumber, address, gnDivision, serviceNumber, gnDivisionNumber

- **GramaNiladhariWithUser.java**: Helper class combining User and GramaNiladhari data
  - Used for displaying complete information in the list view

### 2. DAO Layer

- **GramaNiladhariDAO.java**: Data access object for database operations
  - `create()`: Insert new Grama Niladhari record
  - `findByUserId()`: Get Grama Niladhari by user ID
  - `findAll()`: Get all Grama Niladharis (ordered by name)
  - `update()`: Update existing Grama Niladhari record
  - `delete()`: Delete Grama Niladhari by user ID

### 3. Controllers (Servlets)

All servlets are in the `com.resqnet.controller.admin` package and require DMC role authentication:

- **GNListServlet.java** (`/dmc/gn-registry`)

  - GET: Display list of all registered Grama Niladharis
  - Combines user and GN profile data for display

- **GNAddServlet.java** (`/dmc/gn-registry/add`)

  - GET: Show registration form for new Grama Niladhari
  - POST: Process new GN registration
    - Creates user account with GRAMA_NILADHARI role
    - Creates GN profile
    - Validates username/email uniqueness
    - Password hashing with BCrypt

- **GNEditServlet.java** (`/dmc/gn-registry/edit`)

  - GET: Show edit form with pre-filled data (requires ?id= parameter)
  - POST: Process GN profile updates
    - Updates GN profile information
    - Note: Username and email are not editable (disabled in form)

- **GNDeleteServlet.java** (`/dmc/gn-registry/delete`)
  - POST: Delete Grama Niladhari account
    - Deletes from users table (cascades to grama_niladhari table due to FK constraint)
    - Requires confirmation from user

### 4. JSP Views

Both views use the `dmc-dashboard` layout tag for consistent UI:

- **list.jsp** (`/WEB-INF/views/dmc/gn/list.jsp`)

  - Displays all Grama Niladharis in a table
  - Shows: Name, Division, Contact Info, Username
  - Actions: Edit and Delete buttons
  - "Add new GN" button
  - Success/error message alerts
  - Responsive design with mobile-friendly table
  - JavaScript confirmation for delete action

- **form.jsp** (`/WEB-INF/views/dmc/gn/form.jsp`)
  - Dual-purpose form for add and edit modes
  - Fields: Division Name*, Division Number, Full Name*, Service Number, Contact Number*, Address, Email*, Username\*
  - Password field (only for add mode) with "Generate" button
  - In edit mode: Email and username fields are disabled
  - Form validation
  - Cancel button returns to list
  - Responsive grid layout

## Security Features

- Role-based access control: Only DMC admins can access these pages
- Session validation on all requests
- Password hashing with BCrypt
- SQL injection prevention through PreparedStatements
- Username/email uniqueness validation
- CSRF protection through proper form handling

## Database Schema

Uses existing `grama_niladhari` and `users` tables:

- Foreign key from `grama_niladhari.user_id` to `users.user_id` with CASCADE delete
- User role set to 'grama_niladhari'

## URL Routes

- `/dmc/gn-registry` - List all GNs
- `/dmc/gn-registry/add` - Add new GN (GET for form, POST for submission)
- `/dmc/gn-registry/edit?id={userId}` - Edit GN (GET for form, POST for submission)
- `/dmc/gn-registry/delete` - Delete GN (POST only)

## Features

✅ List all registered Grama Niladharis in a table
✅ Add new Grama Niladhari with auto-generated or manual password
✅ Edit existing Grama Niladhari profiles
✅ Delete Grama Niladhari accounts (with confirmation)
✅ Success/error message feedback
✅ Responsive design for mobile devices
✅ Clean, reusable admin dashboard layout
✅ Password generator for easy registration
✅ Form validation
✅ Role-based access control

## Testing Notes

To test this feature:

1. Log in as a DMC admin user
2. Navigate to the "GN Registry" section from the dashboard
3. Test adding a new Grama Niladhari
4. Test editing an existing GN
5. Test deleting a GN (with confirmation)
6. Verify success/error messages appear correctly
7. Test responsive design on different screen sizes

## Code Quality

- ✅ Follows existing project patterns and conventions
- ✅ Uses existing layout components for consistency
- ✅ Minimal, focused changes
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns (Model, DAO, Controller, View)
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Security best practices
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities (CodeQL verified)
- ✅ Compiles without errors or warnings
